Canvas Pong
===========

My attempt to turn [jakesgordon's](https://github.com/jakesgordon) awesome HTML pong game into an interactive projected version.

 * You can find the [game here](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/demo.html)
 * You can find out [how it works](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/14/javascript_pong/index.html)

You can also play this game in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omimkinlomnncbmnceacpkmlbfaapojj?hl=en-US)
